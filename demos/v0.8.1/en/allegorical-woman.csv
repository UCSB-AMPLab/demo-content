1,demo-atlas-allegory,0.5,0.5,1,What is Telar?,"A framework for visual storytelling. This example explores an allegorical map that reveals more than it first appears to show. 

To see how it's built, [peek behind the scenes to see the source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iHNXqlAx8GsKc5dB42zZO-OmiCXP1jc4gbflms3xaMw/) and follow along.",,,,
2,demo-atlas-allegory,0.5,0.5,1,What is this image?,"This 1761 engraving appears to celebrate the Spanish empire — but as we’ll see, it actually challenges it. Historian Natalie Cobo guides readers through telling details.",,,,
3,demo-atlas-allegory,0.477,0.125,8.9,Notice the head,Spain is depicted as the head of this imperial project.,About Coordinates,"This step zooms to **x=0.477, y=0.125, zoom=8.9**. The x and y values (0 to 1) position the view within the image, and the zoom value magnifies the detail.

Each coordinate choice serves the narrative. Here, extreme zoom emphasizes Spain’s symbolic position as the “head” of empire. In the next steps, coordinates will pan across the body to build the argument.

In your own story, change x and y to pan to different parts of the image, and increase zoom to see more detail. Start with 0.5, 0.5, 1.0 and refine using the **Identify Coordinates** tool on any object page.",,

7,demo-atlas-allegory,0.5,0.5,1,Trade routes,"This allegorical woman is not defined by landmasses but by shipping lanes. Connection, not territory, holds this body together.",The Reveal,"After five steps of zooming into details — head, necklace, Americas, Philippines — this step returns to the full view (x=0.5, y=0.5, zoom=1.0) for synthesis. Pulling back reveals the whole: this empire is defined by connection, not geography.

This is a narrative technique: zoom in to build your argument through details, then zoom out to synthesize and reveal your thesis. Full view works well for orientation and conclusion.

You are reading a “Learn more” panel right now. Click **Progressive Disclosure** below to learn how these nested panels work.",Progressive Disclosure,"You are now viewing a layer 2 [[panel]] — the deepest level of detail in Telar.

Telar offers three levels of depth for each step: the question and answer (visible immediately), a “Learn more” panel (opens when the reader clicks the button), and a “Go deeper” panel like this one (opens from within the first panel). Most steps need only the question and answer. Add panels when you have more to say.

In your spreadsheet, write panel content directly in the layer1_content and layer2_content columns. You can also link glossary terms using double-bracket syntax: [[IIIF]] becomes a clickable link to the term’s definition."

9,demo-leviathan,0.486,0.177,3.6,Leviathan,"Hobbes’s political thesis shows the opposite: the ruler as container of all society, with people who are indistinct and fungible.",Using Multiple Images,"This step switches from atlas-allegory to leviathan in the object column. Each step can show a different image — just change the object_id to match any image listed in your objects tab.

Telar supports two types of images. The Atlas allegory comes from Princeton’s digital library via [[IIIF]] — its source_url points to a manifest hosted by the institution. The Leviathan frontispiece is a self-hosted image — no source_url needed, just a file in your repository that Telar tiles automatically at build time.

Cobo uses the Leviathan to show contrast: Hobbes depicts the ruler as container of all society, while our allegorical map squeezes the ruler into the bottom margin. The comparison strengthens her thesis about connection versus territory.",,
10,demo-atlas-allegory,0.5,0.5,1,A challenge to the king,"Our allegorical woman has no form beyond connection, and the ruler is squeezed into the bottom. This image was produced in Manila by Filipino engraver Laureano Atlas, accompanying Vicente de Memije’s thesis. In context, it stands as a polemical challenge to Charles III’s reforms. This narrative demonstrates how visual storytelling can build scholarly arguments.",What’s Next?,"This story demonstrates how Telar builds scholarly arguments through visual exploration:

- **Coordinate-driven storytelling**: Zoom and pan guide attention to details that build your thesis
- **Progressive disclosure**: Question and answer, then “Learn more” and “Go deeper” panels let readers choose their depth
- **Multiple image types**: IIIF images from institutional collections and self-hosted images from your own repository
- **Glossary integration**: Define terms once, link them anywhere with `[[term-id]]`

This narrative uses the scholarly analysis developed by **Natalie Cobo**, whose work demonstrates how visual exploration can challenge historical narratives and reveal hidden contexts of production.",,

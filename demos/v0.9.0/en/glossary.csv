panel,Panel,"Expandable content that appears over the viewer when you click “Learn more” or similar buttons. Panels provide additional context without leaving the current step.

Telar supports two layers of panels:
- **Layer 1**: Opens from the main step
- **Layer 2**: Opens from within layer 1

This progressive disclosure allows readers to choose their depth of engagement."
step,Step,"A single screen in a Telar story, combining narrative text on the left with an image view on the right. Each step can focus on a different part of an image using coordinates (x, y, zoom).

Steps follow the Question/Answer/Invitation pattern: a compelling question, a brief answer, and optional layer panels for deeper exploration."
story,Story,"A sequence of steps that form a visual narrative. Each story appears as a separate entry in the project sheet and can be navigated independently.

In Telar, stories combine text and images to build arguments, explore themes, or guide readers through visual material. The demo story you are viewing is an example of a story that teaches while it tells."
viewer,Viewer,"The interactive image panel on the right side of the screen. It supports high-resolution zoom and pan, allowing readers to explore image details.

The viewer works with both IIIF images (hosted by museums and libraries) and self-hosted images (from your own collection). Readers can zoom and pan freely, but your coordinates guide their initial view at each step."
IIIF,IIIF,"IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is an open standard that lets institutions share high-resolution images online. Museums, libraries, and archives publish IIIF manifests — structured URLs that describe an image and its metadata.

In Telar, paste a manifest URL into the source_url column of your objects tab and Telar handles the rest: zoom, pan, and deep-zoom all work automatically. This story uses both a self-hosted image (atlas-allegory) and an external IIIF manifest from Princeton (leviathan)."

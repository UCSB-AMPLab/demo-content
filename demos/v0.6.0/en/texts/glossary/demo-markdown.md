Markdown is a lightweight markup language created in 2004 by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/), with the idea that plain text formatting should be readable as-is, even before being converted to HTML. Unlike word processors that hide formatting codes, Markdown uses simple, intuitive syntax: asterisks for emphasis (`*italic*` or `**bold**`), hash marks for headings (`# Heading`), brackets for links (`[text](url)`), and dashes for lists.

The original design goal was to make writing for the web as easy as writing an email. This led to multiple "flavors" of Markdown emerging over the years—[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (a rigorously specified standard), [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (adding tables and task lists), and others. Despite variations, they all share the same core syntax and remain readable as plain text.

Telar uses [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) with several extensions enabled: footnotes for scholarly citations, tables for structured data, and more. This means you can write panel content in a simple text editor, using familiar plain-text conventions.

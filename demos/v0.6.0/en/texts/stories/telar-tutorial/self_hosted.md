You don't need to rely only on institutional collections - **Telar can work with your own images**.

**How it works:** see [Local IIIF images](https://telar.org/docs/iiif-integration/#option-1-local-images) in the Telar Docs
1. Place high-resolution images in `components/images/`
2. Telar automatically generates [[demo-iiif-tiles]] during the build process
3. Your images get the same zoom and pan capabilities as materials from major institutions

**The result:** This ceramic figure uses locally-generated IIIF tiles, while the previous map came from the Huntington Library. Notice how they work seamlessly together - readers can't tell the difference.

**Mix and match:** Combine your own photographs, documents, and artifacts with materials from museums and archives worldwide to tell rich, multi-source stories.

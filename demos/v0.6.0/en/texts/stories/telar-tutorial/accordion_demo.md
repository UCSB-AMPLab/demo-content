**Example - History of Santa Barbara, California:**

## 13,000 years ago – 1542
Chumash communities thrived along the Channel and islands, navigating tomols, creating rich art, and sustaining villages from Mescalitan Island to the mainland.

## 1542 – 1822
Cabrillo sailed the Channel in 1542; Vizcaíno named it "Santa Barbara" in 1602. Portolá camped here in 1769. Spanish settlers built the Presidio (1782) and Mission Santa Barbara (1786); the 1812 quake and tsunami destroyed the first mission, prompting the larger complex that stands today.

## 1822 – 1848
Independence shifted authority to Mexico; missions were secularized, and vast ranchos (Refugio, Dos Pueblos, Las Positas) set up. In 1824, a Chumash-led uprising—sparked by mistreatment—rose from Santa Ynez to Mission Canyon.

## 1846 – 1900
U.S. troops captured Santa Barbara in 1846; the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made the shift official. Santa Barbara incorporated in 1850, the railroad arrived in 1887.

## 1900 – 1945
Silent-film studios (1910–1922) briefly made Santa Barbara a movie hub. The 1925 earthquake leveled downtown; rebuilding embraced Spanish Colonial Revival. Oil strikes and WWII bases—including the site that became UCSB—diversified work and migration.

## 1945 – 2000
Postwar growth strained housing and traffic. The 1969 offshore oil spill catalyzed modern environmental activism and local growth caps.

## 2000 – present
Catastrophic wildfires (Tea 2008, Jesusita 2009, Thomas 2017–18) and the 2015 Refugio oil spill tested the region. Coastal science, tourism, and UCSB anchor the local economy and keep Santa Barbara connected to the world beyond.

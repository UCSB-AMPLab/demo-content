Telar uses a **question-and-answer model** for each step. The question and answer appear in the main interface, while these slide-over panels provide additional context and details.

**Navigation varies by device:**

:::tabs
## Desktop & Laptop
Use your **mouse wheel or trackpad** to scroll through story steps. Telar accumulates scroll distance until you've scrolled about 50% of the viewport height, then smoothly transitions to the next step.

You can also use **keyboard navigation**:
- Arrow keys (up/down, left/right)
- PageUp/PageDown
- Space (with Shift for backward)

## Tablets (iPad)
Use **touch swipe gestures** to navigate - swipe up or down on the screen. Telar detects swipe distance and direction to move between steps.

Keyboard shortcuts work if you have an external keyboard connected.

## Mobile Phones
Use the **arrow buttons** that appear at the bottom of the screen. These buttons are always visible on small screens for reliable navigation.

Swipe gestures also work on mobile devices.

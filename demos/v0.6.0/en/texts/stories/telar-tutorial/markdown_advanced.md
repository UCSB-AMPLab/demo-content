[[Markdown]] enables rich text formatting with simple, readable syntax:

**Advanced features include:**

*Block quotations* for highlighting passages:
> This gold figure, dating from 600-1600 CE, demonstrates the Muisca's sophisticated metalworking techniques.

**Footnotes** for scholarly citations:[^1]

**Lists** for organizing information:

- Bulleted lists for items
- Numbered lists for sequences
- Nested lists for hierarchies

**Links** to external resources and documentation

**Images and videos** can be embedded directly in panels (more on this in Step 10)

For complete details on all available formatting options, see the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://telar.org/docs/reference/markdown-syntax/) in the Telar docs.

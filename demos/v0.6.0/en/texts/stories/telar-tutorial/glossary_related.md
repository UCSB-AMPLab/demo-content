**Related terms feature:**

Each glossary entry can specify related terms that appear as clickable links at the bottom of the glossary panel. This helps readers explore connected concepts.

For example, the [[iiif|IIIF glossary entry]] lists related terms like:
- [[iiif-manifest|IIIF Manifest]] - How images are described
- [[iiif-tiles|IIIF Tiles]] - How zoom functionality works

This creates a **web of interconnected definitions**, allowing readers to dive deeper into topics that interest them.

**Custom link text:**

You can customize how links appear in your text:
- `[[iiif]]` displays as "IIIF"
- `[[iiif|the IIIF framework]]` displays as "the IIIF framework"
- `[[iiif-tiles|these tiles]]` displays as "these tiles"

This flexibility lets you maintain natural prose while still providing access to definitions.

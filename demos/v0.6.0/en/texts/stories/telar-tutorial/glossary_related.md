**Related terms feature:** see [glossary auto-linking](https://telar.org/docs/content-structure/#glossary-auto-linking) in the Telar docs

Each glossary entry can specify related terms that appear as clickable links at the bottom of the glossary panel. This helps readers explore connected concepts.

For example, the [[demo-iiif|IIIF glossary entry]] lists related terms like:

- [[demo-iiif-manifest|IIIF Manifest]] - How images are described
- [[demo-iiif-tiles|IIIF Tiles]] - How zoom functionality works

This creates a **web of interconnected definitions**, allowing readers to dive deeper into topics that interest them.

**Custom link text:**

You can customize how links appear in your text:

- `[[demo-iiif]]` displays as "IIIF"
- `[[demo-iiif|the IIIF framework]]` displays as "the IIIF framework"
- `[[demo-iiif-tiles|these tiles]]` displays as "these tiles"

This flexibility lets you maintain natural prose while still providing access to definitions.

Telar is built on [[demo-iiif|IIIF]] (International Image Interoperability Framework), an open standard that makes it easy to deliver, view, and annotate high-resolution images on the web (see the [IIIF integration guide](https://telar.org/docs/iiif-integration/) in the Telar docs).

**Why IIIF matters:**

- Access images from thousands of cultural heritage institutions worldwide
- Work with materials from museums, libraries, and archives
- No need to download or store large image files
- Images remain on the institution's servers with proper attribution

**This map** comes from the Huntington Library's [[demo-iiif-manifest|IIIF collection]] and loads seamlessly in Telar.

**Find IIIF resources:** see [External IIIF resources](https://telar.org/docs/iiif-integration/#option-2-external-iiif-resources) in the Telar docs

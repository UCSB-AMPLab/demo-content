Telar gives you precise control over what your reader sees at each step. Every story step defines:
- **x coordinate** (0 to 1, left to right)
- **y coordinate** (0 to 1, top to bottom)
- **zoom level** (1.0 = full image, higher numbers zoom in)

**This ornate title page** features portrait medallions of seven supposed indigenous rulers of the Muisca before the Spanish invasion, along with four battle scenes in the border decorations.

**In the next few steps**, we'll demonstrate how pan and zoom work by exploring different details of this single image. Notice how Telar smoothly transitions between views, guiding your reader's attention to specific areas.

**Try it yourself:** Readers can also manually zoom and pan any image at any time using the viewer controls, but your carefully chosen steps create a guided narrative path through the material.

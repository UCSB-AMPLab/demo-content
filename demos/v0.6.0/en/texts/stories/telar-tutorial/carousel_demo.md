Telar includes three **interactive widgets** for presenting information in structured ways:

## Carousel Widget

The carousel widget displays a sequence of 2-6 images with captions. Use it for:
- Showing related materials
- Comparing different perspectives
- Presenting a visual sequence

**Example - Project sponsors:**

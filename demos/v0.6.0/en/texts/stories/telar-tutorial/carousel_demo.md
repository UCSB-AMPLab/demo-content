Telar includes three **interactive widgets** for presenting information in structured ways (see the [widgets section](https://telar.org/docs/content-structure/#widgets-in-story-panels) in the Telar docs):

## Carousel Widget

The [carousel widget](https://telar.org/docs/content-structure/#carousel-widget) in the Telar docs displays a sequence of 2-6 images with captions. Use it for:

- Showing related materials
- Comparing different perspectives
- Presenting a visual sequence

**Example - Project sponsors:**

Telar panels can include **rich media** alongside text:

**Images** can be embedded directly using [[markdown]] syntax. Control image sizing with `{sm}`, `{md}`, `{lg}`, or `{full}` tags:

![AMPL Logo](/components/images/ampl-logo.png){sm}

**Videos** can also be embedded, allowing you to combine [[iiif]] images with multimedia explanations, oral histories, or documentary footage.

**Combine everything** to create compelling scholarly narratives:
- [[iiif|IIIF images]] from global repositories
- Locally-hosted materials with auto-generated [[iiif-tiles]]
- Pan and zoom navigation to guide attention
- Two-layer panel system for progressive disclosure
- Full [[markdown]] formatting with footnotes
- Glossary auto-linking for technical terms
- Interactive widgets (carousel, tabs, accordion)
- Embedded images and videos in panels

**The result:** A rich, interactive reading experience that combines archival materials, scholarly interpretation, and multimedia storytelling - all from a simple set of CSV files and markdown text.

Telar detects swipe distance and direction to move between steps.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts work if you have an external keyboard connected.\n\n## Mobile Phones\nUse the **arrow buttons** that appear at the bottom of the screen.

Click any of them to see the full glossary definition.\n\n**Multiple perspectives with tabs:**\n\n:::tabs\n## For Readers\nThe glossary helps readers understand technical concepts without cluttering the main narrative. Terms are linked the first time they appear in each step, providing definitions when needed.\n\n## For Authors\nYou write glossary entries once and reuse them throughout your stories.

Portolá camped here in 1769. Spanish settlers built the Presidio (1782) and Mission Santa Barbara (1786); the 1812 quake and tsunami destroyed the first mission, prompting the larger complex that stands today.\n\n## 1822 – 1848\nIndependence shifted authority to Mexico; missions were secularized, and vast ranchos (Refugio, Dos Pueblos, Las Positas) set up. In 1824, a Chumash-led uprising—sparked by mistreatment—rose from Santa Ynez to Mission Canyon.\n\n## 1846 – 1900\nU.S. troops captured Santa Barbara in 1846; the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made the shift official. Santa Barbara incorporated in 1850, the railroad arrived in 1887.\n\n## 1900 – 1945\nSilent-film studios (1910–1922) briefly made Santa Barbara a movie hub. The 1925 earthquake leveled downtown; rebuilding embraced Spanish Colonial Revival. Oil strikes and WWII bases—including the site that became UCSB—diversified work and migration.\n\n## 1945 – 2000\nPostwar growth strained housing and traffic. The 1969 offshore oil spill catalyzed modern environmental activism and local growth caps.\n\n## 2000 – present\nCatastrophic wildfires (Tea 2008, Jesusita 2009, Thomas 2017–18) and the 2015 Refugio oil spill tested the region. Coastal science, tourism, and UCSB anchor the local economy and keep Santa Barbara connected to the world beyond.\n:::\n\nReaders can click to expand the panels that interest them, making accordions ideal for optional deep-dive content."

              "content": "The *Painting of the lands, marshes, and swamps of the town of Bogotá* is a manuscript that works both as a map and as a landscape painting and belongs to the genre of legal maps.\n\nWhile most legal maps were outlines or simple plans, this map is special not only for its use of color and elaborate designs, but because it is signed by its author, Juan de Aguilar Rendón, who identified himself as painter, and Alonso Ruiz Gadálmez, the guarantor.\n\nThe full title is *Painting of the lands, marshes, and swamps of the town of Bogotá, made by order of the Royal Audiencia of this city of Santafé of the New Kingdom of Granada, for proceedings between the crown prosecutor and don Francisco Maldonado de Mendoza. By us, Alonso Ruiz Gadálmez, receptor, and Juan de Aguilar Rendón, painter, in the month of April of the year 1614*.\n\nThe acknowledgement of authorship is a rare occurrence both in legal maps and in colonial paintings in the New Kingdom of Granada. At the time, the concept of authorship itself had a very different meaning from the one we use today. The signature, the use of the term \"painting,\" and the use of color are indications that the author was also creating a piece that could be appreciated for its aesthetic qualities.\n\nMoreover, the signatures of the painter and guarantor ensured the validity of the land survey and legitimized its use in court as a truthful representation of the territory.\n\nAlthough we do not know the origin of the paints used on the map, the production of inks and colors was a complex process involving vegetable and animal pigments that were then transformed into paint using methods rich with cultural significance. We have evidence that the Muisca and other Indigenous groups used a wide palette of blue, red, and brown pigments which they applied to designs on textiles, rocks, and other surfaces. For this reason, it is possible that some of the colors used in the *Painting* were produced using Indigenous methods.\n\nAnother important aspect of the *Painting's* visualization of the landscape is its scale. Unlike contemporary maps, which guarantee precision by maintaining a single scale throughout the image, the Painting uses a multiple, flexible, and variable scale. The center of the map—which represents the territory disputed by Maldonado y Mendoza and the crown prosecutor—uses a more homogeneous scale, whereas the borders are variable, allowing the observer to see relatively remote landmarks like the city of Santafé and the towns of Fontibón and Madrid as points of reference."

This approach, commonly called \"[deep zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom)\" or \"tiled pyramids,\" addresses a key challenge in web-based image viewing: high-resolution photographs or manuscript scans can be far too large to download and display at once.\n\nThe tiling system works by creating multiple versions of the source image at different resolutions (a pyramid) and dividing each resolution level into a grid of small tiles. When a viewer displays this image, it only requests the specific tiles needed for the current viewport and zoom level.\n\nThis is the same technology used by [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) (you don't download the entire map of the world to view your neighborhood). The IIIF [Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/) standardizes how to request these tiles.\n\nWhen Telar generates IIIF tiles from your local images, it creates this pyramid structure automatically, producing thousands of individual tile images from a single source photograph or scan.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n- [IIIF Image API specification](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/)\n- [Deep Zoom on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom)"

These APIs work together to enable sophisticated viewing experiences—deep zoom, comparison, annotation, and more—using any IIIF-compatible viewer or tool.\n\nBy 2025, IIIF has been adopted by over 500 institutions worldwide, including the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/), the [Vatican Library](https://digi.vatlib.it/), [Yale University](https://collections.library.yale.edu/), the [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/), the [J.

      "content": "Markdown is a lightweight markup language created in 2004 by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/), with the idea that plain text formatting should be readable as-is, even before being converted to HTML. Unlike word processors that hide formatting codes, Markdown uses simple, intuitive syntax: asterisks for emphasis (`*italic*` or `**bold**`), hash marks for headings (`# Heading`), brackets for links (`[text](url)`), and dashes for lists.\n\nThe original design goal was to make writing for the web as easy as writing an email. This led to multiple \"flavors\" of Markdown emerging over the years—[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (a rigorously specified standard), [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (adding tables and task lists), and others. Despite variations, they all share the same core syntax and remain readable as plain text.\n\nTelar uses [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) with several extensions enabled: footnotes for scholarly citations, tables for structured data, and more. This means you can write panel content in a simple text editor, using familiar plain-text conventions.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n- [The original Markdown specification by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n- [CommonMark specification](https://commonmark.org/)\n- [Markdown on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)"
